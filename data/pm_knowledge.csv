Project Initiation,Project Charter,"The Project Charter formally authorizes the project and provides the PM with authority to apply resources. It should include: project purpose, objectives, high-level requirements, assumptions, constraints, risks, stakeholders, milestones, and budget summary."
Project Initiation,Business Case,"The Business Case justifies the project investment and should demonstrate: strategic alignment, problem statement, cost-benefit analysis, alternatives considered, and success criteria."
Project Planning,Work Breakdown Structure,"The WBS decomposes project deliverables into smaller, manageable components. Create a WBS by: identifying major deliverables, decomposing to appropriate level, assigning identifiers, verifying decomposition is sufficient."
Project Planning,Risk Management,"Risk Management involves identifying, analyzing, responding to, and monitoring risks. Key steps: risk identification, qualitative/quantitative analysis, response planning, implementation, and monitoring."
Project Execution,Team Management,"Effective team management includes: clear role definition, RACI matrix development, team building activities, conflict resolution protocols, performance feedback, and recognition systems."
Project Execution,Communication,"Project communication should be planned via a Communication Management Plan including: stakeholder communication requirements, information to be communicated, frequency, methods, responsible parties, and escalation paths."
Project Monitoring,Earned Value Management,"EVM integrates scope, schedule, and cost measurement using metrics like: Planned Value (PV), Earned Value (EV), Actual Cost (AC), Schedule Variance (SV), Cost Variance (CV), CPI, and SPI."
Project Monitoring,Change Control,"Change control requires a formal process including: change request submission, impact assessment, change board review, approval/rejection, implementation, and documentation."
Project Closure,Lessons Learned,"Lessons Learned should capture: what went well, what could be improved, recommendations, and knowledge gained. Conduct sessions throughout the project, not just at closure."
Project Closure,Project Handover,"Project Handover requires: finalized documentation, formal acceptance, transition plan, support arrangements, warranty information, and final project report."
Project Planning,Critical Path Method,"The Critical Path Method (CPM) identifies the sequence of critical activities that determine the project duration. To apply CPM: 1) List all activities, 2) Determine dependencies, 3) Create network diagram, 4) Estimate durations, 5) Calculate early/late start/finish times, 6) Identify critical path, 7) Calculate float."
Project Planning,Resource Planning,"Resource planning involves: 1) Identifying required resources (human, equipment, materials), 2) Estimating resource quantities needed, 3) Creating resource breakdown structure, 4) Developing resource histograms, 5) Leveling resources to optimize allocation, 6) Creating resource calendar showing availability."
Project Planning,Budget Development,"Budget development process: 1) Establish cost baseline using bottom-up estimating, 2) Include direct and indirect costs, 3) Add contingency reserves for known risks, 4) Add management reserves for unknown risks, 5) Establish cost control thresholds, 6) Document basis of estimates."
Project Execution,Stakeholder Engagement,"Effective stakeholder engagement requires: 1) Identification and analysis of all stakeholders, 2) Prioritization based on power/interest grid, 3) Development of specific engagement strategies, 4) Regular communication aligned with stakeholder needs, 5) Monitoring engagement levels, 6) Adjusting approach as needed."
Project Execution,Quality Management,"Quality management framework includes: 1) Quality planning (standards, metrics, checklists), 2) Quality assurance (process reviews, audits), 3) Quality control (inspections, testing, defect tracking), 4) Continuous improvement (corrective/preventive actions)."
Project Monitoring,Status Reporting,"Effective status reporting should: 1) Follow consistent format/frequency, 2) Include project metrics dashboard, 3) Highlight accomplishments since last report, 4) Show planned vs. actual progress, 5) Report variances and trends, 6) Identify issues/risks/actions, 7) Provide forecast and upcoming milestones."
Project Monitoring,Issue Management,"Issue management process: 1) Identify and log issues, 2) Assess priority and impact, 3) Assign ownership, 4) Develop resolution plan, 5) Implement resolution actions, 6) Monitor and report status, 7) Close issue once resolved, 8) Update lessons learned."
Agile Project Management,Agile vs. Waterfall,"Key differences between Agile and Waterfall: 1) Iterative vs. sequential development, 2) Progressive vs. upfront requirements, 3) Continuous delivery vs. end delivery, 4) Adaptive vs. predictive planning, 5) Collaborative vs. structured team approach, 6) Response to change vs. following plan, 7) Customer collaboration throughout vs. at requirements/delivery stages."
Project Planning,Estimation Techniques,"Common estimation techniques: 1) Expert judgment - leveraging experience, 2) Analogous estimating - using similar projects, 3) Parametric estimating - statistical relationships, 4) Three-point estimating - optimistic/most likely/pessimistic, 5) Bottom-up estimating - work package level, 6) Planning poker - consensus-based team estimation."
Project Governance,Project Steering Committee,"Project Steering Committee responsibilities: 1) Providing strategic direction, 2) Approving key deliverables, 3) Making critical decisions beyond PM authority, 4) Resolving escalated issues, 5) Approving scope/schedule/budget changes, 6) Ensuring business case viability, 7) Supporting the project and removing organizational barriers."
