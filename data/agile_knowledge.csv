Scrum,What are Scrum ceremonies?,"Scrum ceremonies include: Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective, and Backlog Refinement."
Kanban,What is Kanban?,"Kanban is a visual method for managing workflow that emphasizes continuous delivery while not overloading team members. It visualizes work, limits work in progress, and maximizes flow."
Kanban,What are WIP limits?,"WIP (Work In Progress) limits restrict the number of items in progress at any one time. They help prevent bottlenecks, reduce context switching, and increase flow efficiency."
Agile Principles,What are the key Agile principles?,"Key Agile principles include: customer satisfaction, embracing change, frequent delivery, collaboration, motivated individuals, face-to-face communication, working software as progress measure, sustainable development, technical excellence, simplicity, self-organizing teams, and regular reflection."
Agile Principles,What is the Agile Manifesto?,"The Agile Manifesto values: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools, Working software over comprehensive documentation, Customer collaboration over contract negotiation, Responding to change over following a plan."
Sprint Planning,How should Sprint Planning be conducted?,"Sprint Planning should: 1) Set a clear sprint goal, 2) Select items from the backlog to achieve that goal, 3) Break down items into tasks, 4) Estimate effort, 5) Commit as a team to the sprint backlog."
Daily Standup,What is the purpose of Daily Standup?,"The Daily Standup (or Daily Scrum) is a 15-minute time-boxed event where each team member answers: 1) What did I do yesterday? 2) What will I do today? 3) Are there any impediments in my way? It promotes team communication and identifies blockers quickly."
Retrospective,How to run an effective Retrospective?,"Effective retrospectives should: 1) Create a safe environment, 2) Focus on improvement not blame, 3) Discuss what went well, what didn't, and what could be improved, 4) Result in actionable items, 5) Follow up on previous retro action items."
Scrum,What is a Sprint?,"A Sprint is a time-boxed iteration, typically 1-4 weeks long, in which a potentially releasable product increment is created. Each Sprint has a goal of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan, the work, and the resulting product increment."
Scrum,What is a Product Backlog?,"The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering."
Scrum,What is a Sprint Backlog?,"The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. It is a forecast by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality."
Kanban,What are the core principles of Kanban?,"The core principles of Kanban are: 1) Visualize the workflow, 2) Limit work in progress, 3) Manage flow, 4) Make process policies explicit, 5) Implement feedback loops, 6) Improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally."
Agile Estimation,What is story point estimation?,"Story point estimation is a relative sizing technique used in Agile to estimate the effort required to implement a user story. Points are assigned based on complexity, uncertainty, and effort, rather than time. This approach helps teams consider all factors affecting implementation, not just hours of work."
Agile Estimation,What is Planning Poker?,"Planning Poker is a consensus-based estimation technique where team members make estimates by playing numbered cards face-down, then revealing them simultaneously. If estimates vary significantly, the team discusses their perspectives and re-estimates until consensus is reached. This technique leverages the wisdom of the group while avoiding anchoring bias."
Agile Roles,What does a Product Owner do?,"A Product Owner: 1) Defines and prioritizes the product backlog, 2) Represents customer/business interests, 3) Makes scope decisions, 4) Accepts or rejects work results, 5) Communicates product vision, 6) Ensures the team delivers value."

User Stories,What is a good user story format?,"A good user story typically follows the INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable) and is often written in the format: 'As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [benefit].' Stories should be accompanied by acceptance criteria that clarify when the story is complete."
Agile Metrics,What are common Agile metrics?,"Common Agile metrics include: 1) Velocity - the amount of work completed in a sprint, 2) Burn-down/Burn-up charts - showing work remaining vs. time, 3) Cumulative Flow Diagram - visualizing workflow and bottlenecks, 4) Lead/Cycle Time - time from start to completion, 5) Sprint Goal Success Rate, 6) Defect rate and trends."
